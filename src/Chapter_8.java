    Programming 8.3.1

    Eliminate method insert in Listing 8.2 and write its code inside the for statement.

    Answer:
        public class InsertionSort {
            public static <T extends Comparable<T>> void sort(T[] table) {
                for (int nextPos = 1; nextPos < table.length; nextPos++) {
                    T nextVal = table[nextPos];

                    while(nextPos > 0 && nextVal.compareTo(table[nextPos-1] < 0){
                        table[nextPos] = table[nextPos -1];
                        nextPos--;
                    }
                    table[nextPos] = nextVal;
                }
            }
        }*/
